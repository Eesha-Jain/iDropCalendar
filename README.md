# iDrop Calendar

Some individuals taking eye care medication have trouble remembering to do so, hindering their chances of improving their vision and health. The iDrop Calendar App allows patients to digitally track multiple eyedrops they're taking every day with push notification reminders, statistics, badges for gamification, and download a printable version if necessary. Patients can view their consistency and history with taking their medication. Using this app helps patients become more consistent with their medication prescriptions while allowing doctors and eye care professionals to help their patients more effectively!
