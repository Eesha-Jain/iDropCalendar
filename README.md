#iDrop Calendar

### Information About the Product
Some individuals taking eye care medication have trouble remembering to do so, hindering their chances of improving their vision and health. The iDrop Calendar App allows patients to digitally track multiple eyedrops they're taking every day with push notification reminders, statistics, badges for gamification, and download a printable version if necessary. Patients can view their consistency and history with taking their medication. Using this app helps patients become more consistent with their medication prescriptions while allowing doctors and eye care professionals to help their patients more effectively!

### About the Team
This app was developed by Eesha Jain, a freshman at Interlake High School located in Bellevue, Washington. However, this was built in behalf of [Nanodropper](https://nanodropper.com/), a company that built the only FDA-listed, volume-reducing adaptor for eyedrop bottles. By simply twisting the Nanodropper onto any bottle, you can reduce the drop-size to just what your eye can absorb. Smaller drops are shown to reduce waste, cost, and side effects, ultimately increasing access to expensive prescription eye medications. This app is to assist patients using Nanodropper, but can also be used for patients who are not using it!
